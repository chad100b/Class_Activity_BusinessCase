# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study


# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Apple

* Apple Computer Company was founded in 1976 and changed to Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977.

* The founders of Apple Computer, Inc. (Apple) are Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne

* Apple Pay is a new way to make payments in a peer to peer manner without the need of a bank to perform the transaction. The transaction can be performed on a mobile phone and basically serves as a digital wallet service.

* Apple is a publically traded company with annual revenues over $270 billion and a market capitalization over $1 Trillion.


## Business Activities:

* Apple Pay is a mobile payment and digital wallet service by Apple Inc. that allows users to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web using Safari. 

* Apple Pay is supported on the iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Mac. It is not available on any client device that is not made and sold by Apple (in particular, it cannot be used on any Android device, nor on any browser running on Windows). It digitizes and can replace a credit or debit card chip and PIN transaction at a contactless-capable point-of-sale terminal.

## Landscape:

* Apple Pay supports both international payment schemes—such as American Express, Visa (including Electron and V Pay), Mastercard (including Maestro), and Discover—as well as country-specific domestic payment schemes like China's UnionPay, Japan's JCB, France's Cartes Bancaires, Canada's Interac, Australia's eftpos, Saudi Arabia's mada, Germany's Girocard and Russia's Mir. Participating banks vary by region.
* About two-thirds of merchants accept Apple Pay, but many terminals don't.[24] Due to provisioning differences between countries (and even between issuers), users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country. 

* The service was in preparation for "a long time", as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments.[6] Apple partnered with American Express, MasterCard and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple's potential involvement for years.

* Banks have competing services such as Zelle, as well as other providers such as square and paypal.

## Results

*Apple Pay does not cause additional fees for users and merchants. A card holder has a contract with the card issuer. A merchant has a contract with an acquirer. The acquirer has a contract with the card issuer. In Switzerland, participating card issuers pay for the service. In 2020, Swiss banks paid a fixed commission 0.275 CHF (0.26 USD) quarterly on every card to Apple. Additionally, they paid 0.12% for credit card transactions, and 0.17% for web or app based transactions. Swiss antitrust authorities require that an acquirer pays maximum 0.44% of the transaction amount to the issuer. The competition comission calls this amount "interchange fee". Apple charges between 27% and 39% of the credit card issuers income earned from the acquirer

## Recommendations

* Apple Cash, formerly Apple Pay Cash, is a feature that allows the transfer of money from one user to another via iMessage. When a user receives a payment, the funds are deposited in the recipient's Apple Cash card, where it is available for immediate use at merchants that accept Discover. Alternatively, the user can choose to transfer the balance to a nominated bank account via ACH transfer. Apple Cash is only available in the United States.
